# About-Me
Student, 20 years old. I specialize in developing games based on the Unity engine, C#. 

### Experience 
Two years of practical development followed by the publication of games on the Yandex Games platform (organization [Areoplay Games](https://yandex.ru/games/developer/77960) and i am its only representative). This development included working with the WebGL format, cross-platform, localization settings, PluginYG, monetization and very harsh moderation) Unfortunately, this platform removes games that few visitors have visited, so there are few projects left.

### Current development:
Now I am developing a large project, which I decided to call _"Power Of Elements"_. 
Expected a **TBS** (turn-based strategy) **CCG** (collectible card game) grid-based game with elements of procedural generation and character leveling.
