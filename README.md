# About-Me
Student, 20 years old. I specialize in developing games based on the Unity engine, C#. 

Experience: two years of practical development followed by the publication of games on the Yandex Games platform (the organization Areoplay Games (https://yandex.ru/games/developer/77960) and i am its only representative). This development included working with the WebGL format, cross-platform, localization settings, PluginYG, monetization and very harsh moderation) Unfortunately, this platform removes games that few visitors have visited, so there are few projects left.

Now I am developing a large project, which I decided to call "Power Of Elements". 
Expected a TBS (turn-based strategy) CCG (collectible card game) grid-based game with elements of procedural generation and character leveling.
